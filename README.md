# expand
A very simple extension for google chrome which replaces <br>
internet slang acronyms with their full forms in facebook chat.<br>
For now only capital words are replaced, i.e LOL should be typed instead of lol.<br>
A simple example, typing "ADD" in facebook chat , https://github.com/sktguha/expand/blob/master/snap_without.PNG<br>
converts it into "Address", https://github.com/sktguha/expand/blob/master/snap_with_extension.PNG<br>
Some ideas for future development
- expand slangs in incoming messages
- filter for mature text(basic filter exists as an if statement for now)
- hotkey to disable
- adding filters for specific persons
- adding/disabling/importing/exporting acronyms
